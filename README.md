# Running KMC2D to Calculate Epistatic Effect Kinship Matrix 

Welcome to use **KMC2D** to calculate **Epistatic** (***GXG***) Effect **Kinship Matrix**. In this repository, except this **README**.**md** file, you also should see another **INSTALL**.**md** file for instructions to compile the source code; a **PDF** file for **user manual**, and a sub-directory: **Source_Code**, by which you can compile into a **binary KMC2D** command; One zipped file: **Simulated_Data.zip**, which should be unzipped at first, and by which you can play with the **additive** (Z.CSV) or **dominance** (W.CSV) genotypic matrix data with dimension of **m** rows(markers)x **n** columns (individuals); and another zipped file **Run_Test.zip**, which should be unzipped at first, and by which you can test the availability of GPU **hardware** environment, **CUDA-Nvidia software** **Toolkits**, **Packages**, and tentatively **Run** your data in **bash shell** model. 

Essentially, **KMC2D** only runs on a **CUDA**-capable **GPU** Linux Server. Here, we provide three methods to run the pipeline (See the **User Manual**). You can run the pipeline on our hosting GPU sever, or download the source code, compile and run it on your CUDA-capable GPU server.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact the development team (**bioinfo AT noble.org**) or the first author (**wezhang AT noble.org**).
